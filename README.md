# MobileTechTest

## How run this project
To start the project run the command:

```
$ pod install
```

## Arquitecture

In this project I implemented a ```MVP``` architecture, since for the requirements of the project,
implementing a more complex architecture was not very optimal, keeping it simple opens up possibilities for improvement.

Implementation of protocols and delegates for singleton, creation of interfaces by XIB and programmatically.

For caching, I implemented the ```User Default``` framework, since the data to be handled was not so complex, and its methods are very simple.

## Third-party library

As for the third-party library used, use ```PKHUD```, to improve the user experience by displaying a user-friendly way to fill out the Posts list.
